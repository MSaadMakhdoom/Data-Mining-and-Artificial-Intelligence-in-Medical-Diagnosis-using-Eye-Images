# Segmentation-and-Classification-of-Diabetic-Retinopathy-                                                                                                                # The project focuses on Data Mining and Artificial Intelligence by analyzing eye images that have been segmented and labeled using k-elbow and k-means clustering. The aim is to predict the presence of diabetes by classifying the labels in the images. To achieve this goal, a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and traditional machine learning algorithms were used to classify the images. A custom data loader was created to read the images and train the CNN model in batches. The code primarily utilizes PyTorch, Scikit-Sklearn, and opencv. The outcomes are presented in the form of graphs and have been uploaded to the repository. Overall, it is an interesting project that demonstrates the power of machine learning in medical diagnosis.
